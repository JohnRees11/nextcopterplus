==Where can I find OpenAero2Serial firmware?==
The latest files are always listed at the bottom of the first post in the RCGroups OpenAero2 thread.

A link to the latest beta version of OpenAero2Serial can be found on [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=22394780&postcount=1 RC Groups.com]

As shown in the following diagram, the two piezo buzzer output pins indicate the front of the KK2 board, while the four buttons indicate the rear of the board.

==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==
The KK2 board should be installed within your aircraft between your receiver and second flight controller, to stabilize your model.

===Powering the KK2 Board===
A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this will be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.
This will provide power to both the KK2 board and the receiver.

We also recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBECs from Hobbyking.

==How do I connect my receiver?==
The OpenAero2Serial supports single-wire CCPM or Serial receivers (S.Bus, Satellite, Xtreme).

===CPPM Receivers===
Single-wire receivers can be connected to the *THR* input for both signal and power.
While there are many brands available, the following have been tested.

 * [http://www.frsky-rc.com/ShowProducts.asp?id=126 FrSky D8R-XP]

===Serial receivers===
Serial receivers connect to the KK2 board via the *Throttle* input. Some of these require a cable adapter to function.

For the Spektrum Satellite, please use the following cable available from HobbyKing.

===Binding satellite receivers===
OpenAero2 makes it easy to bind Satellite receivers without the need for a separate host receiver.
 # Ensure that the Satellite receiver is connected via the adapter cable.
 # Hold down button 4 of the KK2 board.
 # While holding down button 4, apply power to the KK2 board. The attached Satellite receiver should start to blink rapidly. Release button 4. 
 # Switch on the TX in binding mode. The is usually done by holding down the Bind button on the TX module. The TX module should flash.
 # After a few seconds the Satellite will complete the binding process and will show a solid lit LED.

===Channel Order===
OpenAero2 supports the JR/Spektrum, Fubata and Spektrum Satellite channel allocations.

|| *JR/Spektrum* || *Futaba*|| *Satellite* ||
||CH1: Throttle ||CH1: Aileron #1|| CH1: Flap ||
||CH2: Aileron #1 ||CH2: Elevator|| CH2: Aileron ||
||CH3: Elevator ||CH3: Throttle|| CH3: Elevator ||
||CH4: Rudder ||CH4: Rudder|| CH4: Rudder ||
||CH5: Gear switch ||CH5: Gear switch|| CH5: Gear ||
||CH6: Aux 1 ||CH6: Aileron #2|| CH6: Throttle ||
||CH7: Aux 2 ||CH7: Aux 1|| CH7: AUX1 ||
||CH8: Aux 3  ||CH8: Aux 2 || CH8: AUX2 ||

==How do I connect my servos?==
The OpenAero2 mixer presets support either conventional 'aeroplane mode' or 'flying-wing mode'.

All unassigned channels, designated as 'none' by the mixer presets, can be manually customized for other purposes.

===Aeroplane Mode===
The following channel assignment will apply to most conventional aeroplanes.

  * M1: Throttle - for CPPM users
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left aileron
  * M7: Right aileron
  * M8: Rudder

Where a single aileron servo is required, M6 will become the master and M7 will remain unassigned as 'none'.

===Flying-Wing Mode===
  * M1: Throttle - for CPPM users
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left elevon
  * M7: Right elevon
  * M8: Rudder

===Servo Rate===
Depending on the servo rate selected in the General Menu, the type of receiver you have, and whether Camstab mode is activated, the servo output rate varies. The various rates are illustrated in the table below.
The rate varies from as low as your receiver sends, to up to 300Hz.

Do not select a servo rate of "HIGH" unless you are sure that your servos are rated for it. Typically, analog servos should always be used with the servo rate set to "Low".

|| *Receiver type* || *Servo rate setting*|| *Actual servo rate* ||
|| None (Camstab ON)|| HIGH || ~300Hz `*`||
|| Satellite (11ms) || HIGH || 90Hz `*`||
|| S.Bus (11ms) || HIGH || 90Hz `*`||
|| 50Hz PWM || N/A || 50Hz ||
|| None (Camstab ON)|| LOW || 50Hz ||
|| Satellite (Any)|| LOW|| 45Hz ||
|| S.Bus (Any) || LOW|| 45Hz ||
|| 27Hz CPPM || N/A || 27Hz ||

*`*`Warning: Do not use these rates with analog servos.*
