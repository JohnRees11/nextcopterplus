==Where can I find OpenAero2Serial firmware?==
The latest files are always listed at the bottom of the first post in the RCGroups OpenAero2 thread.

A link to the latest beta version of OpenAero2Serial can be found on [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=22394780&postcount=1 RC Groups.com]

The following diagram shows the serial connections to the KK2 board.

==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==
The KK2 board should be installed within your aircraft between your receiver and second flight controller, to stabilize your model.

===Powering the KK2 Board===
A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this will be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.
This will provide power to both the KK2 board and the receiver.

We also recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBECs from Hobbyking.

==How do I connect my receiver?==
The OpenAero2Serial supports single-wire CCPM or Serial receivers (S.Bus, Satellite, Xtreme).

===CPPM Receivers===
Single-wire receivers can be connected to the *THR* input for both signal and power.
While there are many brands available, the following have been tested.

 * [http://www.frsky-rc.com/ShowProducts.asp?id=119 FrSky D4R-II]
 * [http://www.frsky-rc.com/ShowProducts.asp?id=126 FrSky D8R-XP]

===Serial receivers===
Serial receivers also connect to the KK2 board via the *THR* input. Some of these require a cable adapter to function.

For the Spektrum Satellite, please use the following cable available from HobbyKing.

===Binding satellite receivers===
OpenAero2 makes it easy to bind Satellite receivers without the need for a separate host receiver.
 # Ensure that the Satellite receiver is connected via the adapter cable.
 # Hold down the relevant button of the KK2 board as per the table below.
 # While holding down the button, apply power to the KK2 board. The attached Satellite receiver should start to blink rapidly. Release the button. 
 # Switch on the TX in binding mode. The is usually done by holding down the Bind button on the TX module. The TX module should flash.
 # After a few seconds the Satellite will complete the binding process and will show a solid lit LED. 

|| *Button* || *Binding mode* ||
||Button 1 || DSM2 1024/22ms||
||Button 2 || DSM2 2048/11ms||
||Button 3 || DSMX 2048/22ms||
||Button 4 || DSMX 2048/11ms||

===Channel Order===
OpenAero2 supports the JR/Spektrum and Fubata channel allocations.

|| *JR/Spektrum* || *Futaba*||
||CH1: Throttle ||CH1: Aileron #1||
||CH2: Aileron #1 ||CH2: Elevator||
||CH3: Elevator ||CH3: Throttle||
||CH4: Rudder ||CH4: Rudder||
||CH5: Gear switch ||CH5: Gear switch||
||CH6: Aux 1 ||CH6: Aileron #2||
||CH7: Aux 2 ||CH7: Aux 1||
||CH8: Aux 3  ||CH8: Aux 2 ||

==How are the channels mapped? ==
The OpenAero2 mixer presets support either conventional 'aeroplane mode' or 'flying-wing mode'.
All unassigned channels, designated as 'none' by the mixer presets, can be manually customized for other purposes.
Channels between CH8 and CH16 are passed through as-is.

The following channel assignment will apply to most conventional aeroplanes.

  * 1: Throttle
  * 2: Aileron
  * 3: Elevator
  * 4: Rudder
  * 5: Gear
  * 6: Aux 1
  * 7: Aux 2
  * 8: Aux 3

==Using the mixer==
OpenAero2 uses an updated mixer from OpenAeroVTOL and differs significantly from the older OpenAero2 Guides

===RC source A:===
You can select between any of the eight primary input channels, THR to AUX3.
===Volume (%):===
This is the amount of the selected RC channel that is added to the output.
===RC source B:===
You can select between any of the eight primary input channels, THR to AUX3.
===Volume (%):===
This is the amount of the selected RC channel that is added to the output.
===Roll gyro:===
ON/OFF/Reverse.
===Pitch gyro:===
ON/OFF/Reverse.
===Yaw gyro:===
ON/OFF/Reverse.
===Roll acc:===
ON/OFF/Reverse.
===Pitch acc:===
ON/OFF/Reverse.
===Ext. Source:===
There are 16 possible source inputs. CH1 to CH8, then the roll/pitch/yaw gyros, roll/pitch accelerometers and the roll/pitch autolevel (IMU)
===Volume (%):===
This is the amount of the selected source that is added to the output.
